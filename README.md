# Chat Rooms by golang

## Motivation
The best way to learn to code is to code. After learning Golang for a weekend, I implemented a simple chat rooms system which allows multiple users create new rooms and communicate with other members in the same room.

## What I Learn
The major topics I learn from this project are listed below:
- Golang data structure: struct, slice, map, error, etc
- Creating my own package and use other's package on Github
- Socket programming using net
- Passing struct between client and server using encoding/gob
- goroutine, channel, non-blocking channel using select

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/HowardOhMyGod/chat_rooms_golang`
`go get github.com/satori/go.uuid`
`go install message`

Then, use `go run` or `go build` to run or compile server.go and client.go
